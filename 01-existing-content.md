### Business to do
Simple project/task list showing Peter's current workflow:

```
Planters
1. Look at the dxf files from stove to see how perforated bends are drawn
2. Have 2 finished DXF files for 2 different planters
3. Have them cut at seaport
4. assemble/weld them
5. Learn CAD better

Once those 2 planters are done, assuming everything is good, do a photo sh...

Fancy Bike Bags
1. Contact Ignazio to find a producer/seller

Paper Tiffany lamps
(empty)
```

**Observations:**
- Projects as headers
- Numbered steps within projects
- Mix of action items and learning goals
- Notes/context interspersed with tasks
- Simple, flat structure

### SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

**SOP: How to Convert Template to DXF in Solidworks**
- Fabrication workflow documentation

**Plant Patina Transfer (SOP)**
- Artistic/finishing technique

**MIG Welding Parameters for 6061 Aluminum (Spray Transfer)**
Detailed technical reference with:
- Title + intro paragraph
- General recommendations (bulleted, bold labels)
- Nested organization:
  - By filler metal type (ER5356, ER4043)
  - By wire diameter (0.8mm, 0.9mm)
- Tables of parameters
- Inline notes and tips

Example format:
```
General Recommendations:
• Shielding Gas: 100% Argon
• Gas Flow Rate: 15-20 Liters per Minute (30-45 CFH)
• Technique: Use a "push" technique, not a "drag" technique
• Polarity: Direct Current Electrode Positive (DCEP)
• Inductance: The -10 to +10 scale on your welder controls...
```

**Brazing brass SOP**
- Metalworking technique

## Documentation Style Patterns

1. **Clear titles** — descriptive, include technique/material
2. **Brief intro** — context and purpose
3. **Bulleted lists** — with bold parameter names + values
4. **Hierarchical organization** — by category/subcategory
5. **Tables** — for parameter lookup
6. **Inline notes** — tips, exceptions, learnings
7. **Human-readable** — plain text structure, could be markdown

## Implications for Task App

### What the app needs to support:
- **Projects as containers** with flexible internal structure
- **Mixed content types**: tasks, notes, SOPs, references
- **Simple capture**: quick numbered lists, hashtag tagging
- **Rich documentation**: tables, bold labels, nested headings
- **Learning integration**: questions organized by subject, study materials
- **Fabrication workflows**: DXF files, part versioning, BOM
- **Photo/media embedding**: progress photos, SOP illustrations

### Natural workflow patterns:
1. Quick capture → inbox
2. Process → assign to project
3. Work → update progress
4. Reflect → update SOPs/documentation
5. Review → auto-reminders for stale items
