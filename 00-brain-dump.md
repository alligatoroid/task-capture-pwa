# Task/Project Management App — Brain Dump

## Raw Notes (verbatim)

Lathe use questions. What angle used for tool holder? Carbide tip how to angle? Feeds and speeds? For tool steel? What are some intuitive ways to tell by sound and sight? Many of the recording I will make are for learning more and building skills. The so should take questions and organize them by subject and prepare study materials for be to review and be tested on. Use context to infer how to store and organize to do items and reminders. Eg write recommendation for Aunt Mary Jo re: Alzheimer's. Stainless bridges for 14ga hand bend should be no wider than 0.1" Outside 90 no overlap - 120 amps, +0v 30-45deg outside - 90deg fillet on 120v 135amp, +3v for globular transfer, keep tip super close Need to order stainless steel grinding discs Need to get better lighting for working at night**** The stainless cubitron with battery Makita angle grinder worked very quickly grinding the welds and helped not overheat the disc as well. Order welding hats x 4 @ 7.5" measure check. Order 240v cable for welder from spider box. Plant app idea! Already Reminders to try new things kike restaurants, new parkway theater and activity nights, recipes to try etc. Once project work is done for the day, reflect on the work and what improvements it change should be made to the project or workflow itself. This then updates the different parts of the project, such as SOP documentation and how to manuals. An example is how wide to make tabs and slots for 10ga stainless steel ladder cut parts, and how frequently to place them. Ask Claude how to incorporate this workflow into Claude, for example by booting up each session with a .md file that reminds Claude what work mode to go in. Look into taking video and using that to auto generate SOP docs with photos embedded for clarity (harvested from the video) When in work mode, Claude should ask for tags/# on thoughts or idea notes for helping classify them appropriately Improvements to make: for example adding a feature to laser cut parts: label (etch) parts with part numbers. Ask for help with part versioning, revisions, how to make names, bom management etc. not only should it create the management system, but it should also act as a tutor, teaching me how to properly use PLM tools and approaches. Auto reminders about forgotten projects, eg the small hand ring castings. Auto update if something hasn't been touched for Automate purchasing of parts and supplies. Eg my respirator strap broke and i need new welding cartridges for the 3m respirator. I say I need it, just buy it. Need to buy or make metal shims for fabrication. Need to make a mobile app to talk time and input feedback. Eg. I need to order more Tig welding rod and make a holder for partially consumed rod. Little random thoughts and reminders should have a special status. They're short term things i want to do that are important, but dwelling on them too long defeats the purpose of them and adds unnecessary stress. Maybe each time I add a "work note" I have to categorize it by importance, relevance, speed, frivolity, etc. thereafter the ai applies reminders accordingly, and updates "to-do" lists, workflows accordingly. Maybe when I go to add a note/reminder in the app, I'm not even clocked into a "job" or project. Ideally I do clock in so I can be more rigorous in my tracking and focus, but in case I ave a random thought in the middle of my normal workday, I can just type in the random idea, and add a hashtag for #planterbox etc. An important goal for the project is for all of the content, at a basic level, to be very human readable. Very similar to Obsidian, if not a direct copy of it or including Obsidian. I want it to be clean, human readable, obvious in its formatting and structure. Try using automation for dxf processing: add micro joints, collate several part dxfs into one laser ready file, etc. ask Claude to walk you through the fabrication and design process to help suss out details to add to dxf , where to locate micro joints, etc.

## Initial Theme Extraction

### 1. Learning & Skill Building
- Lathe questions, welding techniques, feeds/speeds
- AI organizes questions by subject, prepares study materials, tests user
- Tutor mode for PLM tools, part versioning, BOM management
- "Not only create the system, but teach me how to use it"

### 2. Work/Project Tracking
- "Clocking in" to projects for focus and rigor
- Quick capture of random thoughts with hashtags (#planterbox)
- Categorizing notes: importance, relevance, speed, frivolity
- Auto-reminders about forgotten/stale projects

### 3. Knowledge Management / SOPs
- End-of-day reflection → update SOPs and documentation
- Video capture → auto-generate SOP docs with embedded photos
- Human-readable, Obsidian-like format (or actual Obsidian)
- Clean, obvious formatting and structure

### 4. Task/Reminder System
- Context-aware organization (infer storage/categorization)
- Different reminder behaviors based on category
- "Little random thoughts" = special lightweight status
- Don't dwell on small things — stress-aware design

### 5. Purchasing/Automation
- "Just buy it" for supplies (respirator parts, welding rod, grinding discs)
- Automate recurring purchases
- Track what needs ordering

### 6. Fabrication-Specific Workflows
- DXF processing automation (micro joints, collation, nesting)
- Part versioning, revisions, naming conventions, BOM management
- Tab/slot dimensions for specific materials (10ga SS ladder cuts)
- Part labeling/etching on laser cut parts

### 7. Life Backend (mentioned)
- Paying taxes, organizing finances
- Family trip planning
- Restaurant/activity recommendations ("try new things")

### 8. Input Methods
- Mobile app for voice/text input
- Quick capture without being "clocked in"
- Hashtag-based project association

## Open Questions for Interview

- What's the primary use case? (Fabrication work tracking vs general life management?)
- Build vs buy? (Extend Obsidian? Build custom? Use existing tools?)
- Who's the user? (Just Peter? Team? Family?)
- What's the MVP? (Smallest useful version?)
- What existing tools are you using now?
- Mobile-first or desktop-first?
- How important is offline access?
- Integration priorities? (Calendar, purchasing, CAD tools?)
